# go-tutorial-cloud-native
Go tutorial for cloud native apps, microservice, docker, kubernetes. 

**Goal:**
+ Develop a cloud native app by using Golang
+ Utilize Docker, Kubernetes

## Design Principles of Cloud Native Apps

+ Design for Performance: Responsive, concurrency, efficiency
+ Design for Automation: Automate dev tasks and ops tasks, CI/CD
+ Design for Resiliency: Fault tolerant, self healing
+ Design for Elasticity: Dynamically scale up/down, be reactive
+ Design for Delivery: Short round-trips and automated delivery, CD
+ Design for Diagnosability: Cluster-wide logs, traces and metrics 

## Cloud Native Stack with Go, Kubernetes and Docker

+ Application Platform: Contains Cloud Native App - Golang
+ Cluster Orchestrator: Dynamically executes applications on the cluster - Kubernetes
+ Cluster Scheduler: Manages cluster resources and executes containers - Kubernetes
+ Cluster Virtualization: Manages cluster resources and executes containers - Docker
